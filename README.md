# Redux Toolkit and Redux

This is an app where I manage the state and the store using Redux and Redux Toolkit.

This app is about a movies list and a songs list where I add to each one of them some random data using faker library.

Also, there is a <b>Reset Both Playlists</b> button which resets the state of both of the components when clicked.

The folder structure is the "Functional" way, in order to prevent bugs with circular imports.
